Bid bonds are returned to the bidders who were not awarded after the award decision, as well as in the event of canceling the competition, or after the expiration of the bid validity period, unless the bidder expresses their desire to remain bound by their bid in accordance with the provisions of the Law and the Implementing Regulations.
e. Contrary to the above and where there is no provision requiring the confiscation of the bid bond, the bid bonds are returned to their owners, and the Government Entity may, based on its discretion or at the request of the bidders, release their bid bonds before the award decision, if it becomes clear after the opening of envelopes and the disclosure of prices that the prices of those bids are high, or contrary to the terms and specifications, which prevents awarding to any of them.

**Second:** Any bidder who agrees to the extension must extend their guarantees and inform the Government Entity of this within (two weeks) from the date of the notification requesting the extension.

### **Section Five: Bid Evaluation**

**50 - Confidentiality of Bid Evaluation**

The Government Entity is committed not to disclose any data, drawings, documents, or information related to the evaluation of the received bids, whether the disclosure is written or oral, or to exploit or disclose them to any person. This applies to everything in its possession or what it has learned in the bids about secrets, dealings, or affairs of the competitors, except for the publication of information that the Government Entity is required to publish under the applicable regulations.

**51 - Bid Evaluation Criteria**

It is to be considered in the bid evaluation criteria that they are clear, objective, and achieve the public interest and do not aim to award the services to specific competitors, taking into account the following when preparing them:
1- In works that do not require high or complex technical capabilities, the evaluation of the technical bid is on a pass/fail basis, and the winning bid is the lowest priced.
2- The highest weight in consulting services that require high technical capabilities should be for the technical criteria.

**52 - Correction of Bids**

**First:** The bid examination committee must review the bills of quantities and prices in the bid, whether in their items or their totals, and make the necessary mathematical corrections in the bid.

**Second:** If there is a discrepancy between the price written in words and the price written in figures, the price written in words shall be taken. If there is a discrepancy between the unit price and its total price, the unit price shall be taken, except in the case of a material error in the price written in figures or the total price of the units - such as placing a decimal point in the wrong place - the bid examination committee shall adopt those prices.

<br>

**Third:** If there is evidence confirming the incorrectness of the price according to the correction method mentioned in the second paragraph of this section, the bid examination committee has the right - after verifying the financial balance of the item prices and comparing the price with its counterparts in the bid and other bids, the market price, and the estimated prices - to adopt the price in the bid that it proves to be correct, and the competitor is excluded if they reject this price.

**Fourth:** The bid examination committee may recommend excluding the bid if the mathematical errors in the prices, after being corrected according to the provisions of this paragraph, exceed (10%) of the price list or the total bid value, whether in increase or decrease.

**53 - Examination of Bids**

The bid examination committee, when evaluating bids, adheres to the qualification criteria, evaluation criteria, and competition conditions, taking into account the following:

**First:** If any of the required certificates mentioned in detail in paragraph (6) of this booklet are not available with the bidder, or if the submitted certificates are expired, the bidder is given a period determined by the bid examination committee not to exceed (ten) working days to complete those certificates. If they do not submit them within the specified period, they are excluded from the competition and the bid bond is confiscated.

**Second:** If the competitor omits to price some items, the bid examination committee may exclude their bid or consider the unpriced items as loaded onto the total value of the bid. The competitor is considered to agree to this condition when submitting their bid.

**Third:** In the event of non-execution by the competitor of the items loaded onto the total value of the bid, they are executed at their expense, or what corresponds to their cost is deducted; this is based on the average price of the item among the applicants for the competition, or the price estimated by the bid examination committee in the case of a single bid or the failure of the competitors to price the omitted items.

**Fourth:** If the Government Entity decides not to execute any of the items loaded onto the total value of the bid, what corresponds to its cost is deducted based on the average price of the item among the applicants for the competition, or the price estimated by the bid examination committee in the case of a single bid or the failure of the competitors to price the omitted items.

**Fifth:** If two or more bids are equal in the overall evaluation, the award is made to the lowest priced bid. If they are equal in that, the Government Entity shall divide the competition among the equal bids, provided that the terms and specifications of the competition permit it. If division is not stipulated, priority in awarding is given to small and medium-sized local enterprises, and a closed competition is held among the equal bids if this is not possible.

**Sixth:** The bid examination committee may re-price the items if it finds that they were priced in an unstudied manner and do not represent the true price of the items, provided that this does not affect the total price of the bid. If the competitor refuses to re-price, they are excluded from the competition and their guarantee is returned.

<br>

### **Section Six: Contract Requirements**

**56 - Award Notification**

The Government Entity sends the award letter to the winning competitor(s) via the electronic portal. The letter includes the scope of work, the value, the start date of the contract, and that the award decision does not create any legal or financial obligation on the Government Entity until the contract is signed by all parties.

**57 - Performance Bond (Final Guarantee)**

**First:** The one to whom the award is made must submit a final guarantee of (5%) of the contract value, within fifteen working days from the date of being notified of the award.

**Second:** If the bidder is a small or medium-sized enterprise, they must pay a fine to the Government Entity equal to the value of the bid bond if they do not submit the final guarantee upon award. If (60) sixty days pass from the end of the deadline for submitting the final guarantee without them paying the specified fine, they shall be punished by being banned from dealing with government entities for a period of (one year).

**Third:** The Government Entity must retain the final guarantee until the contractor fulfills their obligations and the project is finally accepted, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.

**58 - Contract Signing**

Taking into account paragraph (2) of Article (Fifty-Five) of the Law, it is not permissible to start executing the contracted works before signing the contract. The Government Entity sets a date for signing the contract after the submission of the final guarantee. If they are late for the specified date without an acceptable excuse, they are warned of this. If they do not appear to sign the contract within (15) fifteen days from the date of their warning, the contract is terminated by a decision of the competent authority, and the final guarantee is confiscated, without prejudice to the right of the Government Entity to seek compensation from the contractor for the damages it incurred. The committee stipulated in Article (Eighty-Eight) of the Law is provided with a copy of the decision to consider this violation.

**59 - Fines**
